# EASY Trade Copier MT4/MT5

This is a sample code for the EASY Trade Copier MT4/MT5, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This code provides the basic functionality for copying trades from a main MT5 account to multiple MT5 and MT4 accounts.

### Installation

To use this code, you need to include the necessary libraries: Trade.mqh and ArrayObj.mqh. These libraries provide the required functions for executing trades and working with arrays.

### Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the trade copying functionality is initialized by calling the `InitializeTradeCopier()` function. If the initialization is successful, the trade execution speed is set to 5 points deviation using the `SetDeviationInPoints()` function.

### Deinitialization

In the `OnDeinit()` function, the trade copier is deinitialized by calling the `DeinitializeTradeCopier()` function.

### Trade Copying

In the `OnTick()` function, the `CopyTrades()` function is called to copy trades from the main MT5 account to multiple MT5 and MT4 accounts. You can add your own code in the `CopyTrades()` function to implement the trade copying functionality.

### Trade Execution

The `CTrade` object `trade` is used for executing trades. You can modify the trade execution speed by changing the deviation in points using the `SetDeviationInPoints()` function.

### Usage

To use this code, you need to implement the trade copying functionality in the `InitializeTradeCopier()` function and the `CopyTrades()` function. You can add your own logic to copy trades from the main account to other accounts.
